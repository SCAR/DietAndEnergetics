<h1>Southern Ocean Diet and Energetics Database</h1>
<p>Information related to diet and energy flow is fundamental to a diverse range of Antarctic and Southern Ocean biological and ecosystem studies. The SCAR Expert Groups on <a href="http://www.scar.org/ssg/life-sciences/eg-abi">Antarctic Biodiversity Informatics (EG-ABI)</a> and <a href="http://www.scar.org/ssg/life-sciences/bamm">Birds and Marine Mammals (EG-BAMM)</a> are collating a centralised database of such information to assist the scientific community in this work. It includes data related to diet and energy flow from conventional (e.g. gut content) and modern (e.g. molecular) studies, stable isotopes, fatty acids, and energetic content. It is a product of the SCAR community and open for all to participate in and use.</p>
