# General aims

Information on diet and energy flow = fundamental to a range of studies

### This project
- data and tools to work with them

- a product of the SCAR community and open for all to participate in and use

# Data types

- conventional diet data (e.g. stomach, scat contents)

&lt;img src="extra/1066-C1m.jpg" style="float:right;clear:none;width:40%;" /&gt;
- stable isotopes

- DNA-based diet identification

- lipids, fatty acids

- energetic content

- allometric equations (e.g. length-mass relationships)

# Software tools

R packages in development for accessing and manipulating these data.

See https://github.com/SCAR/sohungry for data and https://github.com/SCAR/solong for equations.

### Example usage

Load the package and retrieve diet data:

```r
library(sohungry)
xd &lt;- so_diet()
nrow(xd)
```


```

# Data format

Generally, information on:

- date and location of record

- method details

- predator characteristics (taxonomy, size, mass)

- prey characteristics

- measures of diet importance

And similar structures for other data types.

# How can I get involved?

1. **Contribute data** (particularly from under-represented taxa, regions, or data types). If you have data from an unpublished paper, the data can be embargoed until publication.

  - download the template and submit your data: https://github.com/SCAR/DietAndEnergetics

      Or, if you have a lot of data in a consistent format, we may be able to script a batch import.

1. **Join a group** working on a paper

1. **Use the database and R packages**

1. **Contribute analytical code**

1. **Make suggestions** so that this is more useful to the SCAR community
  - how you might use such data
  - what analytical functionality you would like to see
